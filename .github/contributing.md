We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've created new functions make sure there are properly documented. 
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. We use `pytest`. 
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes. We use GitHub Actions for automating the test (*) 
6. Issue that pull request!
7. One reviewer will be added to each PR. The reviewer will review your PR, may ask for changes. Once this is done he will merge your PR in `master`

### PIAF Reviewers
- For all PR related to datascience, reviewers are in order of relevance : 
    - @psorianom
    - @Rob192

(*) Note that the GitHub Actions will use `requirements.txt` for setting up the virtual environment for the testing. 

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
We value your experience from the field using our code. To optimize the impact of your feedback, please use the template format to ease the debugging. 
Add some sample code to ease the debugging !
